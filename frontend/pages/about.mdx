[zkalc](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc) helps you calculate how much time
cryptographic operations take on a real computer

# About zkalc
</center>

Cryptographers tend to be good at cryptography but they can be quite bad at
estimating the time it takes a computer to run their schemes.

We hope that zkalc can help shorten the gap between cryptography and practice:

- Cryptographers can use the simple zkalc UX to learn how fast their paper will
  run on various machines
- Protocol designers can more easily tune the parameters of their protocol
  depending on their requirements

## The zkalc manual

</center>

- Tooltips can help you reach zkalc enlightment <br />
- All benchmarks were run with multithreading enabled unless mentioned <br />
- Results above <InlineMath math="\mathbb{2^{22}}" /> have reduced accuracy due
  to missing benchmarks (see
  [TODO.md](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/TODO.md)) <br />
- Click on the total time to get the result in SI units (seconds) <br />

  ## How to add benchmarks to zkalc?
  <br />
</center>

If a functionality you need is missing, please help us add it! First, make sure
you <Link href="/methodology">check out our methodology page</Link> and then
follow the instructions below:

## I want to add a new cryptographic operation!

zkalc does not currently support all possible cryptographic operations. For
example, maybe you want to add benchmarks for FFTs.

To do so follow the following steps:

- Find the existing benchmarks in the `backend/` directory, and add benchmark
  code for the new cryptographic operation following the
  [already existing conventions](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/blstrs/benches/bench_blstrs.rs).
- Run all benchmarks on your machine by running `make` in the `backend/`
  directory.

Finally, please open a PR with your changes and the json benchmark output files
and we will take care of the rest!

## I want to add benchmarks for a different machine!

zkalc only supports a few machine types right now. Do you have access to a beefy
AWS machine or to some GPU prover? We would love your benchmarks!

Simply run all benchmarks on your beefy AWS machine by running `make` in the
`backend/` directory. Then open a PR with the json benchmark output files and we
will take care of the rest!

If your machine is especially weak (rpi4) or particularly strong (GPU prover)
consider modifying the benchmark parameters (e.g. increase/decrease the size of
the MSMs) and get in touch with us!

## I want to benchmark a different elliptic curve!

zkalc only supports BLS12-381 right now but we would love to support BLS12-377
or curve25519 or whatever really.

To add benchmarks for a different elliptic curve, write benchmarks for the new
curve in the `backend/` directory following the
[already existing conventions](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/blstrs/benches/bench_blstrs.rs).

Note that if your benchmarks do not use the
[criterion benchmark framework](https://docs.rs/criterion/latest/criterion/) you
will need to adapt your benchmark framework to output a JSON file that the zkalc
interpolation script understands (it currently
[understands a small subset](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/fit.py#L128)
of the
[format](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/blstrs/estimates.json)
of criterion's `estimates.json`). If you are confused, get in touch and we will
help.

Finally, please open a PR with your changes and the json benchmark output files
and we will take care of the rest!

## I want to benchmark a different cryptographic libray!

Please follow the same process as adding a different elliptic curve.
