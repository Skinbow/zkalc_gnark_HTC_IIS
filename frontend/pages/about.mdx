[zkalc](https://github.com/zkalc/zkalc) helps you calculate how much time cryptographic operations take on a real computer

<br /><br/>
</center>

Cryptographers tend to be good at cryptography but they can be quite bad at estimating the time it takes a computer to run their schemes.

We hope that zkalc can help shorten the gap between cryptography and practice:
- Cryptographers can use the simple zkalc UX to learn how fast their paper will run on various machines
- Protocol designers can more easily tune the parameters of their protocol depending on their requirements

### The manual

- Tooltips can help you reach zkalc enlightment <br />
- All benchmarks were run with multithreading enabled unless mentioned <br />
- Results above <InlineMath math="\mathbb{2^{22}}" /> have reduced accuracy due to missing benchmarks (see [TODO.md](https://github.com/zkalc/zkalc/blob/main/TODO.md)) <br />
- Click on the total time to get the result in SI units (seconds) <br />
