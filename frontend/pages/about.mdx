[zkalc](https://github.com/zkalc/zkalc) helps you calculate how much time cryptographic operations take on a real computer

<br /><br/>
</center>

Cryptographers tend to be good at cryptography but they can be quite bad at estimating the time it takes a computer to run their schemes.

We hope that zkalc can help shorten the gap between cryptography and practice:
- Cryptographers can use the simple zkalc UX to learn how fast their paper will run on various machines
- Protocol designers can more easily tune the parameters of their protocol depending on their requirements

<br/>

### The manual

- Tooltips can help you reach zkalc enlightment <br />
- All benchmarks were run with multithreading enabled unless mentioned <br />
- Results above <InlineMath math="\mathbb{2^{22}}" /> have reduced accuracy due to missing benchmarks (see [TODO.md](https://github.com/zkalc/zkalc/blob/main/TODO.md)) <br />
- Click on the total time to get the result in SI units (seconds) <br />

<br/>

### I need a library/curve/operation/machine but it's missing!

If something you need is missing, please help us add it!

Perform the following steps to add any missing benchmarks:
- If new benchmarks are needed, write code for them in the `backend/` directory following the [already existing conventions](https://github.com/zkalc/zkalc/blob/main/backend/blstrs/benches/bench_blstrs.rs)
  - If you write non-Rust benchmarks, they must output a JSON file that `perf/fit.py` can understand (it currently [understands a small subset](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/fit.py#L128) of the [format](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/blstrs/estimates.json) of criterion's `estimates.json`)
- Run your benchmarks on the desired machine and move their `output.json` to the `perf/` directory.

Finally, please submit a PR with the above mentioning the specs of your machine and we will take care of the rest!
