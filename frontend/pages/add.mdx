# How to add benchmarks to zkalc?

</center>

If something you need is missing, please help us add it by following the steps below.

## I want to add a new cryptographic operation!

zkalc does not currently support all possible cryptographic operations. For example, maybe you want to add benchmarks for FFT.

To do so follow the following steps:
- Find the existing benchmarks in the `backend/` directory, and add benchmark code for the new cryptographic operation following the [already existing conventions](https://github.com/zkalc/zkalc/blob/main/backend/blstrs/benches/bench_blstrs.rs).
- Run all benchmarks on your machine by running `make` in the `backend/` directory.

Finally, please open a PR with your changes and the json benchmark output files and we will take care of the rest!

## I want to add benchmarks for a different machine!

zkalc only supports a few machine types right now. Do you have access to a beefy AWS machine or to some GPU prover? We would love your benchmarks!

Simply run all benchmarks on your beefy AWS machine by running `make` in the `backend/` directory.
Then open a PR with the json benchmark output files and we will take care of the rest!

If your machine is especially weak (rpi4) or particularly strong (GPU prover) consider modifying the benchmark parameters (e.g. increase/decrease the size of the MSMs) and get in touch with us!

## I want to benchmark a different elliptic curve!

zkalc only supports BLS12-381 right now but we would love to support BLS12-377 or curve25519 or whatever really.

To add benchmarks for a different elliptic curve, write benchmarks for the new curve in the `backend/` directory following the [already existing conventions](https://github.com/zkalc/zkalc/blob/main/backend/blstrs/benches/bench_blstrs.rs).

Note that if your benchmarks do not use the [criterion benchmark framework](https://docs.rs/criterion/latest/criterion/) you will need to adapt your benchmark framework to output a JSON file that the zkalc interpolation script understands (it currently [understands a small subset](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/fit.py#L128) of the [format](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/blstrs/estimates.json) of criterion's `estimates.json`). If you are confused, get in touch and we will help.

Finally, please open a PR with your changes and the json benchmark output files and we will take care of the rest!

## I want to benchmark a different cryptographic libray!

Please follow the same process as adding a different elliptic curve.
