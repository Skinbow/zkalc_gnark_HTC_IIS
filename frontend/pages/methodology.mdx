## Methodology

_**Disclaimer:** zkalc aims to provide adequate results while being easy to use.
Results might be different from our estimates or the obtained samples.
In this page, we describe how samples were obtained and how estimates are being computed._


1. For each supported operation, we run benchmarks that measures its performance.
2. For each operation, we fit the benchmark data to a function which is then exported to the zkalc website.
3. When a user queries zkalc for an operation of size <InlineMath math="n" />, we evaluate the exported function at <InlineMath math="n" />.

We will now go deeper into the above, also linking to the relevant places in the codebase.

## Running benchmarks

Inside [`backend/`](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/) we collect benchmarks for all the crypto libraries and operations we support. [Consider for example](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/arkworks/benches/bench_arkworks.rs) the benchmarks for the `arkworks` library.

<GitHubFile url="https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/arkworks/benches/bench_arkworks.rs#L24-L31" />

Running `make` inside `backend/` will run every benchmark, storing results inside `perf/`, where they are post-processed and collected in our API format.

## Collecting benchmarks

We store in json format benchmarking results inside [`frontend/data`](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/tree/main/frontend/data) and they are free for everyone to use. Given a curve key `curve` (available in `curves.json`), a library key `lib` that supports the given curve (available in `libraries.json`) and a machine key `machine` (available in `machines.json`), it is possible to fetch the samples in the file `data/{curve}/{library}/{machine}.json`. For instance, this is the file reporting the microbenchmarks for curve BLS12-381 using arkworks on a M1 Pro 2021.

## Estimating the running time

Now we have benchmark data for every operation in the `perf/` directory. The next step is to fit a function <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> to every operation.

For simple operations like basic scalar multiplication and field addition which are not amortized we use the benchmark results in a linear fashion. That is, if a single scalar multiplication takes <InlineMath math="x" /> seconds on average, <InlineMath math="n" /> such operations will take <InlineMath math="n \cdot x" /> seconds. That results in a linear function <InlineMath math="f(x) = n \cdot x" /> that can easily be exported to the zkalc website.

## Fitting amortized operations

However, there are also more complicated operations like MSMs which are amortized and their performance doesn't follow a simple linear curve. For example, consider the figure below which displays the benchmark data from a <InlineMath>\mathbb G_1</InlineMath> MSM operation (the x-axis is in log scale):

<Plot data={
    [
        samplesToPlotData(estimates["msm_G1"], "msm on M1 2021"),
    ]
    } height={400} lineWidth={0} />



For these operations, we [collect benchmark data](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/arkworks/benches/bench_arkworks.rs#L52) for various sizes and then perform [polynomial interpolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQsDxOdn1hk) over the entire dataset as can be seen on the figure below.

<Plot data={
    [
        samplesToPlotData(estimates["msm_G1"], "msm on M1 2021"),
        functionToPlotData(estimates["msm_G1"].range, (n) => estimator(estimates["msm_G1"], n), "estimated"),
    ]
    } height={400} lineWidth={1} />

That is, for each pair of benchmark data <InlineMath math="(x_i, f(x_i))" /> and <InlineMath math="(x_{i+1}, f(x_{i+1}))" /> we interpolate a linear polynomial [that goes through both points](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/fit.py). After we interpolate all pairs of points, we end up with a bunch of polynomials. We can then approximate <InlineMath math="f(n)" /> by evaluating the right polynomial at <InlineMath math="n" /> and as long as <InlineMath math="\min(x_i) \le n \le \max(x_i)" /> the interpolated polynomial will evaluate to a value close to <InlineMath math="f(n)" />.

However, if a user asks for <InlineMath math="f(n)" /> where <InlineMath math="n" /> is bigger than <InlineMath math="\max(x_i)" /> we need to extrapolate. In this case, we take the rightmost polynomial and use that to evaluate <InlineMath math="f(n)" /> as we do in the figure below.

<Plot data={
    [
        functionToPlotData(estimates["msm_G1"].range, (n) => estimator(estimates["msm_G1"], n), "estimated"),
    ]
    } height={400} lineWidth={1} />

Observe that the rightmost polynomial is linear and hence it's not able to faithfully follow the non-linear <InlineMath math="f(x)" />. Hence zkalc will get more and more inaccurate the bigger <InlineMath math="n" /> is. See our [TODO document](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/TODO.md) for possible improvements here.
