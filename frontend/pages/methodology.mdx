#  zkalc scientific methodology

</center>

**Disclaimer** zkalc aims to provide adequate results while being easy to use. Estimates might not be actual tests.

Our *scientific methodology* is simple:
1. For each supported operation, we run benchmarks that measures its performance.
2. For each operation, we fit the benchmark data to a function which is then exported to the zkalc website.
3. When a user queries zkalc for an operation of size <InlineMath math="n" />, we evaluate the exported function at <InlineMath math="n" />.

We will now go deeper into the above, also linking to the relevant places in the codebase.

## Running benchmarks

The [`backend/` directory](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/) contains benchmarks for all the crypto libraries and operations we support. [Consider for example](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/arkworks/benches/bench_arkworks.rs) the benchmarks for the `arkworks` library.

Running `make` on the `backend/` directory will run every benchmark and move the results to the `perf/` directory where they will get fitted to functions.

Now we have benchmark data for every operation in the `perf/` directory. The next step is to fit a function <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> to every operation, and then export <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> to Javascript and call it from the zkalc website.

## Fitting simple operations

For simple operations like basic scalar multiplication and field addition which are not amortized we use the benchmark results in a linear fashion. That is, if a single scalar multiplication takes <InlineMath math="x" /> seconds on average, <InlineMath math="n" /> such operations will take <InlineMath math="n*x" /> seconds. That results in a linear function <InlineMath math="f(x) = n*x" /> that can easily be exported to the zkalc website.

## Fitting amortized operations

However, there are also more complicated operations like MSMs which are amortized and their performance doesn't follow a simple linear curve. For example, consider the figure below which displays the benchmark data from a <InlineMath>\mathbb G_1</InlineMath> MSM operation (the x-axis is in log scale):

<Plot data={
    [
        samplesToPlotData(estimates["msm_G1"]),
    ]
    } height={400} lineWidth={0} />



For these operations, we [collect benchmark data](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/arkworks/benches/bench_arkworks.rs#L52) for various sizes and then perform [polynomial interpolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQsDxOdn1hk) over the entire dataset as can be seen on the figure below.

<Plot data={
    [
        samplesToPlotData(estimates["msm_G1"]),
        functionToPlotData(estimates["msm_G1"].range, (n) => estimator(estimates["msm_G1"], n))
    ]
    } height={400} lineWidth={3} />

That is, for each pair of benchmark data <InlineMath math="(x_i, f(x_i))" /> and <InlineMath math="(x_{i+1}, f(x_{i+1}))" /> we interpolate a linear polynomial [that goes through both points](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/fit.py). After we interpolate all pairs of points, we end up with a bunch of polynomials. We can then approximate <InlineMath math="f(n)" /> by evaluating the right polynomial at <InlineMath math="n" /> and as long as <InlineMath math="min(x_i) \le n \le max(x_i)" /> the interpolated polynomial will evaluate to a value close to <InlineMath math="f(n)" />.

However, if a user asks for <InlineMath math="f(n)" /> where <InlineMath math="n" /> is bigger than <InlineMath math="max(x_i)" /> we need to extrapolate. In this case, we take the rightmost polynomial and use that to evaluate <InlineMath math="f(n)" /> as we do in the figure below.

<br />


Observe that the rightmost polynomial is linear and hence it's not able to faithfully follow the non-linear <InlineMath math="f(x)" />. Hence zkalc will get more and more inaccurate the bigger <InlineMath math="n" /> is. See our [TODO document](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/TODO.md) for possible improvements here.

<br />

## Moving the fitted functions to zkalc

Finally, after all operations have been fitted to functions, we [export the functions to Javascript](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/fit.py#L60) and [dump them](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/frontend/data/results_arkworks_macbookpro2021.json) on the `frontend/` directory to be used by the zkalc website.

There is still lots of ways we can improve zkalc. Please check [the TODO file](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/TODO.md) to see how you can also help!
